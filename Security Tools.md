Open-source app sec tools | 

Most open-source projects are designed for app sec requirements at a smaller scale than commercial vendors tend to target. This list of highly dedicated open-source app sec providers should, nevertheless, become familiar to security enthusiasts seeking new, creative approaches to specific kinds of cyber threats.
Some of these open-source projects are quite active and frequently updated with new capabilities; others not so much, but theyâ€™re still worth checking out. Some of the more robust open-source technologies have been around since the dawn of the web; while others are relatively new, with growing hordes of followers on Twitter and elsewhere.
